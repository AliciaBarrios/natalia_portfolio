        <h1>The User Recruitment problem</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>
                I worked for a renowned banking industry, they were struggling to find users to interview. In many companies users can be overprotected, 
                old school stakeholders can be fearful of what we ask, what we tell…</br>

                They don’t want that we show ourselves as someone insecure. Well, that mindset it’s the first challenge of the user researcher!</br>
                
                <span class="bold_word">Every time that we wanted to conduct research it was very difficult to recruit users because of internal blockers.</span> 
            </p>

             <h2>The plan</h2>
             <p>
                Our plan was to create a solid structure of user recruitment that, while understanding business concerns, 
                allowed us to be efficient and bring value to the company with our research. Those results would solidify later 
                on the practice of user research (and user recruitment).</br>

                It was also important to show this project as a cooperative effort, in order to solve and clarify any misconception of the dangers of user recruitment.

            <h2>The method</h2>
            <h3>Qualitative interviews</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Did our users see value in participating? How to create value for them if not? </li>
                <li>Who were the users and how to segment them?</li>
                <li>What activities would our users be willing to do? What topics they would find interesting?</li>
                <li>Do they have pain points related to user research activities that we could solve?</li>
                <li>How can we reward them if they participate? </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Data analysis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How can we segment them in order to target the users we want for each research? Detect the segmentation of our personas.</li>
                <li>How was the actual recruitment process, and recruitment success?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Workshop</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>User Journey with dpt legal PMs and Marketing. How contacting our users affects our business teams</li>
                <li>Brainstorming How can we reward them if they participate?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Learnings</h2>
            <p>We discovered:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Departments were not comfortable with us discovering unregular processes. Also because 
                    they were not open to letting us discuss with the user actual pain points from their experience. 
                    Account managers wanted to have ownership of the communication with the user. </li>
                <li>Sellers don’t understand how to use the feed correctly (we are not clear).</li>
                <li>Our users were <span class="bold_word italic_word">willing</span> to participate, as they are our partners they benefit in their business when we make our job better.</li>
                <li>They didn’t need compensation to help us, <span class="bold_word italic_word">some of them thought it was pleasant to work together,</span> 
                    tough helping several times might require some gratification.</li>
            </ul>
