        <h1>The User Onboarding problem</h1>

        <article>
            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>
                I worked as a User researcher for an E-commerce related to DIY. 
                We onboarded all kinds of sellers. Sellers needed to integrate 
                their already existing catalogue, or create a new one with us.<br/>

                Wait for it, are you seated? There we go: <span class="bold_word">Tickets related to the 
                onboarding were more than 40%, users with no digital maturity didn’t 
                understand our requirements and represented a huge cost for us</span>, both 
                account managers and technical account managers were spending time on 
                repetitive and not so valuable tasks.<br/>
                
                We needed to solve this situation, and for that we need to have <span class="bold_word">an 
                understanding of the Onboarding experience on the merchant side</span>, 
                but also on the Technical account managers and the Account Managers side, 
                in order to <span class="bold_word">identify the root cause of the problem</span> amb make a proposition 
                of <span class="bold_word">how the Perfect Merchant Onboarding should be.</span><br/>
            </p>

             <h2>The plan</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>Identify who are the sellers who struggle the most with the onboarding.</li>
                <li>Identify what makes a seller onboarding excellent.</li>
                <li>Understand and map today’s process to onboard all kinds of sellers.</li>
                <li>Understand sellers needs during the onboarding process.</li>
                <li>Map all the pain points from sellers, and all the agents involved.</li>
                <li>Understand how other marketplaces operate the seller onboarding.</li>
                <li>Propose a solution based on the research.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The method</h2>
            <div class="float_right">
                <img src="../../img/videocall.PNG" alt="Videocall"/>
                <div>
                    <h3>Shadowing sessions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Integration of the catalogue of a seller, with the Technical assistance team.</li>
                        <li>Pitching of the Account managers team to the new sellers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Qualitative methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sellers onboarded recently.</li>
                <li>Sellers that rated -2 stars on the onboarding process.</li>
                <li>Sellers that rated +4 stars on the onboarding process.</li>
                <li>Diary Study</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../img/Structure_for_interviews.PNG" alt="Structure for the interviews"/>
            <h3>Workshops</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To identify the user journey from all participants (Technical account managers, account managers and Sellers)</li>
            </ul>

       <article>
            <h2>The Learnings</h2>
            <p>We found the following insights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Small sellers expressed <span class="bold_word">feeling left alone, no answer to their emails, no solution to their problems.</span></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Too many sellers onboarded, not enough account managers to help them properly,  no content or tools to make them self sufficient.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Lots of sellers have been onboarded without knowing about the quality rules, and our services.</li>
                <li>Sellers don’t understand how to use the feed correctly (we are not clear).</li>
                <li>The error report it’s not actionable.</li>
                <li>Sellers report a great onboarding only when the account manager did manage personally all the parts of their onboarding.</li>
                <li>There is a lack of content for seller’s to manage on their own.</li>
                <li><span class="bold_word">A huge number of repetitive and manual</span> task done by Account Managers and Technical Account Managers makes the process very slow 
                    and full of human mistakes. (+45 minutes detected that could be done automatically)</li>
                <li>Miscommunication between AM and TAM, no visibility and <span class="bold_word">no understanding of each other actions/decisions,</span> impacting the seller.</li>
            </ul>
