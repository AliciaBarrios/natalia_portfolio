        <h1>The Engagement Problem</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>
                A commercial Operation is a process where the business encourage sellers to participate in specific campaigns. They can be seasonal, like Christmas, 
                Black Friday… Or by category, Swimming pools during summer, for example.</br>

                Having said that, our sellers were not participating as much as we hoped, heavily affecting our BV.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article>
             <h2>The plan</h2>
             <p>
                Our goal is to learn how the sellers and our account managers are living the experience of the Commercial Operations 
                in order to identify all the pain points and opportunities.</br>

                The proposal from our stakeholders was: <span class="italic_word">“Let’s do a tool to help them onboard!”</span></br>
                
                And that might help, but the research team thought that a deeper exploration was needed in order to truly discover 
                why they were not participating, and hopefully discover some solutions during the process.

            <h2>The method</h2>
            <h3>Qualitative interviews</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify <span class="bold_word">who are the sellers who participate</span> to Commercial Operations and understand <span class="bold_word">what are 
                    their motivations</span> and trigger to participate.</li>
                <li>Identify <span class="bold_word">who are the sellers who do not participate</span> to Commercial Operations and understand why.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Workshop</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand and <span class="bold_word">map today’s process in our company to organize, setup and onboard sellers into CO</span> Workshops 
                    to define the user journey from internal workers.</li>
                <li>Understand and <span class="bold_word">map sellers experience when they participate to CO</span> Workshops to define the user journey from sellers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Benchmark</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn what is the CO sellers experience in other Marketplaces and identify opportunities of improvement for ManoMano.</li>
            </ul>
       </article>
       <article>
            <h2>The Learnings</h2>
            <p>We found that lots of sellers don’t see value on joining the CO because of the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They <span class="bold_word">don’t have enough data to measure the profitability</span> of CO.</li>
                <li>They <span class="bold_word">need to spend a lot of time on manual modifications</span> on the catalog.</li>
                <li>They don’t have enough profitability, considering the <span class="bold_word">low margin, and the time invested.</span></li>
                <li><span class="bold_word">Too much time</span> invested for <span class="bold_word">low profit.</span></li>
                <li>Too generic CO and<span class="bold_word">lower impact</span> with more competition between sellers</li>
                <li><span class="bold_word">Annoying manual process</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>We gathered a big list of opportunities that they are now being implemented, such as</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sooner communications about the CO, to let them be able to prepare with more time.</li>
                <li>Improvements on how they could upload their catalogue and offers. Prioritization on the queues for those sellers who participated in CO.</li>
                <li>Lower commission rate during commercial operations.</li>
                <li>Improve the user-friendliness of the data offered about the CO.</span></li>
                <li>...</li>
